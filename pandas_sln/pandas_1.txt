Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: by writing the code --> df = pd.read_csv('link')
                            df 
and copy the link of your CSV data from the resource you are accessing it.

Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: by simply writing type and name of the column or a dataset 
example df.dtype , basically its df.dtype() but if you will found error then you can remove brackets.

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
ans: for top rows
    1.  by writing df.head()  it is sellecting 5 rows by default and if you  want to give condition then we mention the number of required rows inside the brackets example df.head(10), now you will get top 10 rows.
    for bottoms 
    1. by writing df.tail() , same as above it will select 5 rows by default, to select 2 bottoms rows you can can write it as df.tail(2).  

Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans : using rename() function.    

Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans : by wrting df.drop('column name ', axis=1, inplace=True) by this you can drop your columns. here by mentioning  1 you are delting  colmun and if you want to drop rows you can write 

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans :  df.['name of column'].unique() is the way you can find unique values of pandas dataframe.

Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans : df.isnull().sum()

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
ans : df.isnull()

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?
ans : frames = [df, df1]
 
      res1 = pd.concat(frames)
      res1

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
ans : df_concat = [ df1 , df2 ]
      res = pd.concat(df_concat)
      res 

Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
 ans : by writing the code in this this bleow formate, in which you are grouping the two set of data from dataframe where we have mentioned name of the column.
       df.groupby(['Name', 'Qualification'])

       print(df.groupby(['Name', 'Qualification']).groups).

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: Download or import the data that you want to use.
     In the pivot_table function, specify the DataFrame you are summarizing, along with the names for the indexes, columns and values.
     Specify the type of calculation you want to use, such as the mean. 
     Use multiple indexes and column-level grouping to create a more powerful summary of the data. 

Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: by  DataFrame.apply()  

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column?
ans: Sorting Your DataFrame on a Single Column. To sort the DataFrame based on the values in a single column, you'll use . sort_values().

Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: by using Pandas DataFrame copy() Method

Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?
ans: by Using  DataFrame.loc[] to filter by multiple conditions
           df2 = df.loc[(df['Fee']>=24000) & 
             (df['Discount']< 2000) & 
             (df['Courses'].str.startswith('P')),
                    ['Courses','Duration']]

Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: by using Using mean() function.
     This method is using the pandas mean() method. Let's find the average using this method. 
     If you will apply mean() on the entire dataframe then it will find mean for the entire numeric column in the dataframe.

Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: Standard deviation is calculated using the function . std() 

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans: Print the input DataFrame, df. Initialize two variables, col1 and col2, and assign them the columns that you want to find the correlation of.
     Find the correlation between col1 and col2 by using df[col1]. corr(df[col2]) and save the correlation value in a variable, corr.

Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?
ans: by Selecting  One Column by Name df. loc[:, 'column1'] or whatever the name of the column.

Q21.How do you selec t specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?
ans: You can select a single row from pandas DataFrame by integer index using df. iloc[n] .
     Replace n with a position you wanted to select.

Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?
ans: Using . sort_index() with the optional parameter axis set to 1 will sort the DataFrame by the column labels. 

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?
ans: by writing df['new_col'] = df['Survived'] + df['Pclass']
df.head(). in this survived and Pclass are another column and new column will be a result as sum of values of both alloted colmuns.  
     

Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?
ans: The drop_duplicates() method removes duplicate rows.

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?
ans: here loc means lock. the diffrence between them is that .loc is user index and ilock is system index.
